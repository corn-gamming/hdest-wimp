## What?
What's In My Pack? (WIMP) is an addon for [Hideous Destructor](https://codeberg.org/mc776/hideousdestructor) that overhauls the Backpack's UI; adding two "sorting modes" that help you look through your backpack.

WIMP introduces two modes:
- WIMP: What's In My Pack? Shows what's in your backpack.
- WOMP: Does the opposite of WIMP.

You can switch modes by pressing `Zoom`.

Don't like the colours? Don't worry, you can change them in `WIMP Options`.

## Patches
Inside the folder named [`wimp-patches`](wimp-patches), you'll find some patches I made for other addons that adds new backpacks.   
While you don't have to use them, they do make the new backpacks use WIMP's system.

To use the patches, just load them after WIMP and whatever addon the patch is meant to support.

If you want an addon to be supported, feel free to make a issue request or let me know about the addon.
