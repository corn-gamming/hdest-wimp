## What?
What's In My Pack? (WIMP) is an addon for [Hideous Destructor](https://codeberg.org/mc776/hideousdestructor) that changes the Backpack's UI, and adds some "viewing modes" that help you look through your backpack.

WIMP adds three modes to the Backpack.
- All: The default backpack behaviour, shows all items.
- WIMP: Shows items in backpack.
- WOMP: Does the opposite of WIMP.

You can switch between modes by holding `Firemode` and pressing either `Fire` or `AltFire` to cycle left and right respectively.

Don't like the colours? Don't worry, you can change them in `WIMP Options`.
