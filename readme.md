# What's In My Pack? (WIMP)

## What?
WIMP is an addon for [Hideous Destructor](https://codeberg.org/mc776/hideousdestructor) that changes the Backpack's UI.

Note: This addon requires [Ugly as Sin](https://github.com/caligari87/Ugly-as-Sin) to work. (for the time being)

WIMP adds three modes to the Backpack.
- All: The default backpack behaviour, shows all items.
- WIMP: Shows items in backpack.
- WOMP: Does the opposite of WIMP.

You can switch between modes by crouching, and pressing either `Fire` or `AltFire` to cycle left and right respectively.
