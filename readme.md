## What?
What's In My Pack? (WIMP) is an addon for [Hideous Destructor](https://codeberg.org/mc776/hideousdestructor) that changes the Backpack's UI, and adds some "sorting modes" that help you look through your backpack.

WIMP adds three modes to the Backpack.
- All: The default backpack behaviour, shows all items.
- WIMP: Shows items in backpack.
- WOMP: Does the opposite of WIMP.

You can switch between modes by holding `Zoom` and pressing either `Fire` or `AltFire` to cycle left and right respectively.

Don't like the colours and new layout? Don't worry, you can change them in `WIMP Options`.

## Patches
Inside the folder named [`wimp-patches`](wimp-patches), you'll find some patches I made for other addons that adds new backpacks.   
While you don't have to use them, they do make the new backpacks use WIMP's UI.

If you want an addon to be supported, feel free to make a issue request or let me know about the addon.
